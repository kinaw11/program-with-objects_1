  <div id="contentone">
    <h1>Lesson One</h1>
    <em><b>HTML</b></em>
    <p class="my-paragraph">Hyper Text Markup Language, this is the main document type of the web, it glues everything together. HTML is made up of Text content this is what you see and Markup this is what it looks like. It also makes references to other documents, images and
      videos.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>THE WEB</em>
    <ul class="four">
      <li>Servers- computers that host the files that makeup the web</li>
      <li>Internet- the world’s largest computer network</li>
      <li>Browsers- a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li>
      <li>URLS- How you refer to documents on the web.</li>
      <li>HTTP- protocol of the web</li>
      <li>Hyperlinks- links in between pages</li>
      <li> It was developed in the 1990’s</li>
      <li>30 billion pages</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>TAGS AND ELEMENTS OH MY</b>
    <br>
    <ul class="five">
      <li>Markup is made up of tags, tags are always contained within angled brackets most having opening and closing however some that are called void tags do not require closing tags.</li>
      <li> Opening Tag Content Closing tag</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>COMPUTERS ARE JUST NOT SMART</b>
    <br>
    <ul class="six">
      <li>Computers are not smart because they interpret instructions literally.</li>
      <li> This makes them very unforgiving.</li>
      <li>One small mistake will turn into huge problems</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>INLINE AND BLOCK</em>
    <br>
    <ul class="seven">
      <li>these are known as container Elements</li>
      <li>Inline are span, a br, img and strong</li>
      <li>Block is div, p, form,block elements form an invisible box around the content</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="contenttwo">
    <h1>Lesson Two</h1>
    <em>TWO LANGUAGES</em>
    <ul class="eight">
      <li>HTML CSS </li>
      <li>HTML- Controls the structure of a webpage</li>
      <li>CSS- Cascading Style Sheets language is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>HTML STRUCTURE</em>
    <ul class="nine">
      <li>The Tree like structure of HTML comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them</li>
      <li>DOM- Document Object Model when programmers talk about the “DOM” they are talking about the tree like structure of a page.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>BOXES AND INDENTATIONS</em>
    <br>
    <ul class="ten">
      <li>Boxes, Boxes, Everywhere!!</li>
      <li>Everything is in a box</li>
      <li>The relationship between indented HTML and Boxes As you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document the more indented an element is the more deeply nested its corresponding
        box is.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>TEXT EDITOR</em>
    <p>When writing code programmers use special text editors. These editors make the programmers life easier for example some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML when you write an opening tag.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="contentthree">
    <h1>Lesson Three</h1>
    <em> WHAT IS CSS?</em>
    <ul class="eleven">
      <li>CSS is all about Style</li>
      <li>Color, Shape, Size,Text,Images,Videos</li>
      <li>This sheet language is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in markup language</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em>REPETITION</em>
    <p>Repetition is one of the main things you have to look out for because through repition people have a tendency to make mistakes and not be consistent</p>
    <br>

        <h2> Computers</h2></div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> A computer can be programmed to do whatever we want them to do. As long as we can write the program to the specifications that are needed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="contentfour">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <h2>What is a Computer Program ?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> A program tells the computer what to do Computers can do any computation. Programs are a sequence of steps that a computer follows in order to complete something or be useful. Some examples of programs are games,mobile apps,web browsers all are
          computer programs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2> Programming Language</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>This is what programmers use to tell computers what to do or what they want to happen. An example of a programming language is Python.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Grammar</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>So what is correct or not correct this is what grammar does With computer grammar everything has to be correct not technically correct this means our code has to be correct for the interpreters such as Python if not it will not run</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Python</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>Python is an intepreter that runs our programs on the computer. Python is widely used.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h2>Python Expressions</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>A Python expression is a legal Python statement. Print 5 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 8 + with no number at the end is not.</p>
          <div class="concept-description">Telling computers what to do Python- Test as you go after every step break into smaller bits The Variable What is a variable? Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs. Variables are used to create
            a name, the value of the name equals the value it is referred to Always introduce a variable before you use it What does it mean to assign a value to a variable? Variables help code readability by using names, we can also change the value
            of things and store data. To do that we can name some data haircolor and define the variable haircolor using the following statement. haircolor=dark brown Then you can access and modify data by referring to it as haircolor. What are some ways
            that variables are useful? What is the difference between 5+5 and "5"+"5" The 5+5 is added and gives you the sum of 10… 5 is a number “5”+”5” in Python puts the numbers together 55….in Python “5” is a String
          </div>
          <p>What is the difference between what the equal’s means in math versus in programming? Note the = sign has a different meaning , In programming the =sign is known as a assignment sign. It means we are assigning the value on the right side of the
            =sign to the variable on the left.</p>

          <p>To write a comment # Symbol is used , comments start with the #symbol and everything after the symbol hash is ignored by python but the programmer can see it.</p>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Strings</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes “please don’t string me along” or ‘please don’t string me along’ you can use single or double quotes. If you start with a single quote you have to end with a single quote, If you start with a double
            quote you have to end with a double quote. For space in a string annotate this way ‘please don’t string me along ‘ you have to put a space before the quotation at the end. Strings and numbers will produce an err Example: name=’kina’ ‘kina’*12
            will not work But quotations will work in this manner name=’kina’ end=’!’ name + end *12 Kina!!!!!!!!!!!!
          </div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Index</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">An index, in your example, refers to a position within an ordered list. Python strings can be thought of as lists of characters; each character is given an index from zero (at the beginning) to the length minus one (at the end). For the string
            "Python", the indexes break down like this: P y t h o n 0 1 2 3 4 5 In addition, Python supports negative indexes, in which case it counts from the end. So the last character can be indexed with -1, the second to last with -2, etc.: P y t
            h o n -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 Integers these are numbers with no decimal parts -3,-2,-1,0,1,2 Float refers to numbers with Decimal points 12.345,-67.897 String refers to text List refers to a collection of data that are related. Instead of storing
            them as separate we can place them together Tuple are just like list but you cannot modify their value. The initial value is what will stay for the rest of the program.</div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>What is a Parameter?</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">Parameters are what go inside the parenthesesFunctions These are simply pre-written codes that perform a certain task. Depending on how the function is written, whether it is a part of a class and how you import it, we can call a function by
            typing the name of the function or by using a dot notation. Some functions require us to pass data in for them to complete a task. </div>
          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Functions/Procedures</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description"> What are Functions/Procedures? they are prewritten codes that perform a certain task. In other words Input and Output taking a situation in and getting a different situation out. Differences between making and using a function, to make a function
            you start off by writing def at the beginning of your code like so def then giving the function a name like kina, blue, green, ect.. that will become values. We then specify what to do with the input. Example def kina(x) love= x+x return love
            In order to use a function you would write the name the put the value in parenthases like print kina(2) your answer would be 4 How do Functions help with repetition ? One and Done is the analogy i use. Create it one time and you never have
            to create it again. What if No return statement is involved? You will get the answer of none because you are not asking for a computation. def kina(x): love=x+5 love_overboard=kina(10) print love_overboard >>>None Telling Computers What To
            Do Compiler does it all at onceInterpreter interprets Group related facts into big ideas then summarize those ideas with a few sentences add these ideas and summarize to the HTML for your webpage: Topics to consider are: Computer, Program,

          <p>Boolean Value are True or False when comparing values they need to be the same type. Compare intergers with intergers and strings with strings</p>
          <p> Procedure is the same as Function What is print function they are prewritten code that defines a certian task What does it mean to Call a function, you do this by writing the function name followed by an open parentheses followed by the values
            for the required parfameters followed by a close parentheses always include print before calling a function Condition statements the program will proceed depending on coditions being met if,elif and else are utilized for this</p>

          <div class="concept-title">
            <h2>Structured Data</h2></div>
          <div class="concept-description"> Strings and Lists are structured data strings are a sequence of characters list are a sequence of anything there are also different ways to use lists and different things you can do to a list like a list can be nested meaning there are list
            inside of lists. Mutation is changing the value of a part of the list and once that value is changed it can affect the value of other variables. Aliasing is two different ways to refer to the same object. Append means to add to a list and
            Concatenation is putting two or more lists together.</div>

              <h2>PROGRAM WITH OBJECTS</h2>
              <div class="concept-title">
                <em><b>Object Oriented Programming</b></em></div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <p class="my-paragraph"> When researching OOP-Object Oriented Programming I came across alot of interesting and Great information but this definition gave me a nutshell view of what it means is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are
                  data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often
                  modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated . In OOP programming, computer programs are designed by making them outg of objects that interact with one another. There is significant diversity in object-oriented
                  programmin, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type, Wikipedia nailed it. Why is it important? OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs
                  which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface. ,OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small
                  differences to existing ones. ,OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.

                <em><b>Python Library And Its Uses</b></em></div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <p class="my-paragraph"> The library describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly
                  included in Python distributions.Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents. There are built in functions, built in constants, buit in types, built in exceptions
                  this goes on and on, Great reference Guide. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="concept-title">
                <em><b>Terms That Are Important</b></em></div>
              <div class="concept-description">
                <ul class="twelve">
                  <li> Class: Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method
                    can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified
                    further after creation.</li>
                  <li> Instances: Not unlike the ambiguity between "class" and "type", "instance" is synonymous to "object". Think of it this way: objects are instances of types. So, "42 is an instance of the type int" is equivalent to "42 is an int object".
                    I usually use "instance" and "object" interchangeably. In some cases when I want to specifically refer to objects as artifacts of the CPython implementation, I will try to use "instance" to refer to actual instances of classes. Another
                    place where the term "instance" is explicitly used by Python is in built-ins like isinstance and the special __instancecheck__ attribute
                  </li>
                  <li>Instance Variable: Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.</li>
                  <li>Class variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods.</li>
                  <li>Objects: Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored program computer,” code is
                    also represented by objects.) Every object has an identity, a type and a value.
                  </li>
                  <li>Constructor: In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) in a class is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the
                    constructor uses to set required member variables. A constructor resembles an instance method, but it differs from a method in that it has no explicit return type, it is not implicitly inherited and it usually has different rules for
                    scope modifiers
                  </li>
                  <li>Self Variable: That's the key difference between a function and a class method. A function is floating free, unencumbered. A class (instance) method has to be aware of it's parent (and parent properties) so you need to pass the method
                    a reference to the parent class (as self). It's just one less implicit rule that you have to internalize before understanding OOP</li>
                  <li>Instance Method are bound function objects. Methods are always bound to an instance of an user-defined class. Unbound methods (methods bound to a class object) are no longer available.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="concept-title">
                <em><b>Thinking, Thinking, Thinking</b></em></div>
              <p> The many programs we had to write in this course which included Take a Break, Turtle and doing the Movie web page to learn a few were both fun and interesting. These situations challenged me and also instructed me to ask the questions that
                programmers should ask, What is the Input ? How to get what you need ? and What is the output? However the last practice project which challenged you to look at CSS classes and HTML opened me up to a new world. Thinking more about Object Oriented Programming and how it can be used in relation to my HTML (Thanks for  the video which gave me a better understanding) I see how OPP can be used by creating a Class from the Concept we have in this document you can create the Class and then create objects from that particular Concept. From there we can make several instances each one can having variables such as title and desciption the function can be generate_html this will create the HTML from this page. At first it took me a while to work through then once the light bulb went off I understood. To remind myself with more clarity on how to do this the notes were also included below </p>
              <ul>
              <li>First start off with an outline and ask yourself the questions about, input, output, how to go from input to output.</li> <li>Second define your Class</li> <li> Be explicit in inheriting</li><li>Define a Constructor Function called __init__</li><li>You can then pass in title and description</li><li>Then create your instance function</li> <li>The HTML generator funtion inside Class was refactored, now when a function is called the title and description will be pulled from the object instance. This makes it easier you can change your objects in different ways</li>
